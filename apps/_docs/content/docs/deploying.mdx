description: How to deploy next-forge
---

next-forge is designed to be deployed on Vercel with the [BetterStack](https://vercel.com/integrations/betterstack) and [Sentry](https://vercel.com/integrations/sentry) integrations. This will take care of the relevant API keys and tokens.

If you're deploying on Vercel, I recommend making use of the Team Environment Variables feature. Variables used by libraries need to exist in all packages and duplicating them can be a headache.
