next-forge is designed to be deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), however you can likely deploy it to any other platform that supports Next.js such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## How to deploy

To deploy next-forge, you need to create 3 new projects on Vercel for the `app`, `api` and `web` apps. After selecting your repository, change the Root Directory option to the app of choice e.g. `apps/app`. This should automatically detect the Next.js setup and as such, the build command and output directory.

Then, just hit "Deploy" and Vercel will take care of the rest.

## Environment variables

If you're deploying on Vercel, we recommend making use of the Team Environment Variables feature. Variables used by libraries need to exist in all packages and duplicating them can be a headache.

## Integrations

We also recommend installing the [BetterStack](https://vercel.com/integrations/betterstack) and [Sentry](https://vercel.com/integrations/sentry) integrations. This will take care of the relevant API keys and tokens.
