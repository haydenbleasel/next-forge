description: How to handle payments in next-forge
---

As you can guess, `next-forge` uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payments. The setup is handled in the `api` app, which contains the serverless functions for handling payments.

## In-App Purchases

TBD.

## Webhooks

Stripe webhooks are handled in the `POST /webhooks/stripe` route in the `api` app. This route constructs the event and then switches on the event type to determine how to process the event.

### Local Development

To test webhooks locally, we've configured the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local server. This will start automatically when you run `pnpm dev`.
