description: How to handle authentication in next-forge
---

[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is used for authentication in next-forge. Clerk provides a complete authentication and user management solution that integrates seamlessly with Next.js applications.

## In-App

The shared provider from the `@repo/design-system` package (called `DesignSystemProvider`) includes the Clerk provider. This means that you only need to include the `DesignSystemProvider` in your app to use Clerk.

## Webhooks

Clerk uses webhooks to handle authentication events. These are handled in the `POST /webhooks/clerk` route in the `api` app.

### Local Development

TBD.
