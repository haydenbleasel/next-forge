description: How next-forge handles analytics
---

`next-forge` makes use of three Analytics libraries:

| Platform   | Usage                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vercel Analytics    | Collects performance metrics, page views, and user interactions to help improve the app's performance and user experience. |
| Google Analytics    | Tracks user behavior, page views, session duration, and other engagement metrics to provide insights into user activity and marketing effectiveness. |
| Segment             | Aggregates data from various sources, including user identification, group membership, and page views, to streamline data collection and integration with other analytics and marketing tools. |

Segment in particular is handy for creating an analytics pipeline, sending user information and behaviour to a tool of your choice, like Amplitude or Mixpanel. We've wired it up as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User Action in App] -->|Triggers| B[Clerk Webhook]
  A -->|Client-Side Call| D3[page Call]
  B -->|Sends Data| C[API Webhook Handler]

  subgraph App
    C
  end

  subgraph Clerk
    B
  end

  subgraph Segment
    D1[identify Call]
    D2[group Call]
    D3[page Call]
  end

  C -->|User Invites / Updates| D1
  C -->|Organization Invites / Updates| D2
  C -->|Organization Membership Invites| D2
```

Google Analytics is also enabled if you create a `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` environment variable.
