description: We have three analytics libraries in next-forge.

## Vercel Web Analytics

Vercel's built-in analytics tool offers detailed insights into your website's visitors with new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics. All you have to do to enable it is visit the Analytics tab in your Vercel project and click Enable from the dialog.

Read more about it [here](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart).

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics tracks user behavior, page views, session duration, and other engagement metrics to provide insights into user activity and marketing effectiveness. GA tracking code is injected using [@next/third-parties](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries#google-analytics) for performance reasons.

To enable it, simply add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` environment variable to your project.

## Posthog

Posthog is a single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. It comes with lots of products, including a web analytics tool, event analytics, feature flagging, and more.

TBD.

We've combined it with Clerk webhooks to wire it up as follows:

<Mermaid chart={`
graph TD
  A[User Action in App] -->|Triggers| B[Clerk Webhook]
  A -->|Client-Side Call| D3[page Call]
  B -->|Sends Data| C[API Webhook Handler]

  subgraph App
    C
  end

  subgraph Clerk
    B
  end

  subgraph @repo/analytics
    D1[identify Call]
    D2[group Call]
    D3[page Call]
  end

  C -->|User Invites / Updates| D1
  C -->|Organization Invites / Updates| D2
  C -->|Organization Membership Invites| D2
`} />

### Custom Proxy

next-forge makes use of a custom proxy setup for Posthog's client-side library to avoid ad-blocker issues. This is not required, but recommended.
