## Vercel Web Analytics

Vercel's built-in analytics tool offers detailed insights into your website's visitors with new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics. All you have to do to enable it is visit the Analytics tab in your Vercel project and click Enable from the dialog.

Read more about it [here](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart).

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics tracks user behavior, page views, session duration, and other engagement metrics to provide insights into user activity and marketing effectiveness. GA tracking code is injected using [@next/third-parties](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries#google-analytics) for performance reasons.

To enable it, simply add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` environment variable to your project.

## Posthog

Posthog is a single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. It comes with lots of products, including a web analytics tool, event analytics, feature flagging, and more.

We've combined it with Clerk and Stripe webhooks to wire it up as follows:

<Mermaid chart={`
graph TD
  A[User Action in App] -->|Triggers| B[Clerk Webhook]
  A -->|Triggers| E[Stripe Webhook]
  A -->|Client-Side Call| Posthog
  B -->|Sends Data| C1[webhooks/clerk]
  E -->|Sends Data| C2[webhooks/stripe]

  subgraph API
    C1
    C2
  end

  subgraph Posthog
  end

  C1 -->|Clerk Events| Posthog
  C2 -->|Stripe Events| Posthog
`} />

We've also setup Next.js rewrites to reverse proxy Posthog requests, meaning your client-side analytics events won't be blocked by ad blockers.
