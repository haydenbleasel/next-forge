title: Dark Mode
description: How to use dark mode in the design system.
---

next-forge comes with built-in dark mode support through the combination of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) and [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

## Implementation

The dark mode implementation uses Tailwind's `darkMode: 'class'` strategy, which toggles dark mode by adding a `dark` class to the `html` element. This approach provides better control over dark mode and prevents flash of incorrect theme.

The `next-themes` provider is already configured in the application, handling theme persistence and system preference detection automatically. Third-party components like Clerk's Provider and Sonner have also been preconfigured to respect this setup.

## Usage

By default, each application theme will default to the user's operating system preference.

To allow the user to change theme manually, you can use the `ModeToggle` component which is located in the Design System package. We've already added it to the `app` sidebar and `web` navbar, but you can import it anywhere:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { ModeToggle } from '@repo/design-system/components/mode-toggle';

const MyPage = () => (
  <ModeToggle />
);
```

You can check the theme by using the `useTheme` hook directly from `next-themes`. For example:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

const MyPage = () => {
  const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme();

  return resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? 'Dark mode baby' : 'Light mode ftw';
}
```

## Caveats

Currently, it's not possible to change the Clerk theme to match the exact theme of the app. This is because Clerk's Theme doesn't accept custom CSS variables. We'd like to be able to add the following in the future:

```jsx title="packages/design-system/providers/clerk.tsx"
const variables: Theme['variables'] = {
  // ...

  colorBackground: 'hsl(var(--background))', // [!code ++]
  colorPrimary: 'hsl(var(--primary))', // [!code ++]
  colorDanger: 'hsl(var(--destructive))', // [!code ++]
  colorInputBackground: 'hsl(var(--transparent))', // [!code ++]
  colorInputText: 'hsl(var(--text-foreground))', // [!code ++]
  colorNeutral: 'hsl(var(--neutral))', // [!code ++]
  colorShimmer: 'hsl(var(--primary) / 10%)', // [!code ++]
  colorSuccess: 'hsl(var(--success))', // [!code ++]
  colorText: 'hsl(var(--text-foreground))', // [!code ++]
  colorTextOnPrimaryBackground: 'hsl(var(--text-foreground))', // [!code ++]
  colorTextSecondary: 'hsl(var(--text-muted-foreground))', // [!code ++]
  colorWarning: 'hsl(var(--warning))', // [!code ++]
};
```
