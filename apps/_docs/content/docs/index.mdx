## What is next-forge?
next-forge is a production-grade [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps. It is designed to be a comprehensive starting point for new apps, providing a solid, opinionated foundation with a minimal amount of configuration.

It is is a culmination of my experience building web apps over the last decade and is designed to get you to build your new SaaS app as quick as possible

## Philosophy

next-forge is focused on a few key principles:

1. The project should be **fast**. This doesn't just mean fast to build, run and deploy. It also means it should be fast to validate ideas, iterate and scale. This is important for finding product-market fit and growing a business.
2. The project should be **cheap**, at least to start. It should avoid a flat cost, or have a generous free tier. I try to make all my projects self-sustaining, so the goal is to avoid any recurring costs upfront and find services that scale with me.
3. The project should be **opinionated**. This means that the tooling should be designed to work together, and the project should be designed to work with the tooling. This is important for reducing friction and increasing productivity.
4. The project should be **modern**. This means that the tooling should be actively maintained, and the project should be designed to take advantage of the latest features. This is important for reducing technical debt and increasing longevity.
