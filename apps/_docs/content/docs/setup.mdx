## Prerequisites

### pnpm

next-forge defaults to using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, but you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) instead.

Learn how to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Stripe CLI

We use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local machine. You can read more about that [here](/docs/payments).

Learn how to [install the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli#install) for your operating system.

### Mintlify CLI

We use the Mintlify CLI to preview the docs locally. You can install it with:

```package-install
npm install -g @mintlify/cli
```

## Installation

### Cloning

Clone the repo using `next-forge` init, replacing `[my-project]` with your project name.

```sh title="Terminal"
npx next-forge init [my-project]
```

This will create a new directory with your project name and clone the repo into it. It will run a setup script to install dependencies and copy `.env` files.

### Login

Login to Stripe with:

```sh title="Terminal"
stripe login
```

### Environment variables

You should change the environment variables in each `.env` or `.env.local` file to match your own configuration e.g.

```js title=".env.local"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
```

Read more about environment variables [here](/docs/env).

### Vercel Toolbar

Go into each application and run `vercel link`, like so:

```sh title="Terminal"
cd apps/app
vercel link
```

## Development

Run the development server with:

```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm dev
```

Open the localhost URLs with the relevant ports listed above to see the app, e.g.

- [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — The main app.
- [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) — The website.
