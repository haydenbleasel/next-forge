description: How to switch from Prisma to Drizzle.
---

next-forge uses [Prisma](https://prisma.io) as its ORM by default. However, you can easily switch to another ORM like [Drizzle](https://drizzle.dev) or [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/).

We selected Prisma because as of writing this, it's the most popular ORM and has a large community and many adapters. However, Drizzle is coming up fast and has some great benefits, primarily around performance.

If you want to switch to Drizzle, you have two options:

1. Keep Prisma and add the Drizzle API to the Prisma client.
2. Go all-in and switch to Drizzle.

Here's how to do both.

## Add Drizzle to Prisma

## Migrate from Prisma to Drizzle

### 1. Swap out the deps

Uninstall the existing dependencies...

```bash
npm uninstall @prisma/adapter-neon @prisma/client prisma --filter database
```

...and install the new ones:

```bash
npm install @drizzle/orm @drizzle/adapter-pg --filter database
```
