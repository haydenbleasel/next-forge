description: How to handle environment variables in next-forge
---

next-forge uses [@t3-oss/env-nextjs](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) to handle environment variables in a type-safe way. This provides runtime validation and autocompletion for all environment variables.

## Overview

Environment variables are defined and validated in `packages/env/index.ts`. The file exports an `env` object that contains all validated environment variables, separated into `server` and `client` variables.

## Structure

The environment configuration is split into two main parts:

- `client`: Variables that are available on the client side.
- `server`: Variables that are available on the server side.

## Adding a variable

To add a new environment variable, simply add it to the `server` or `client` object in `packages/env/index.ts`. The variable will be validated using Zod, so you can use any of the Zod validation primitives.

I recommend being as specific as possible with your validation. For example, if you know that a vendor secret starts with `sec_`, you should validate it as `z.string().min(1).startsWith('sec_')`. This will not only make your intent clearer to anyone reading your code, but will also help prevent errors at runtime.
