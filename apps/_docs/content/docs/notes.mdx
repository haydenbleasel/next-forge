- If you're deploying on Vercel, I recommend making use of the Team Environment Variables feature. Variables used by libraries need to exist in all packages and duplicating them can be a headache.
- `next-forge` makes use of a custom proxy setup for Segment's client-side library to avoid ad-blocker issues. This is not required, but recommended. You'll need to contact Segment support to enable this in your UI. Read more about this [here](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/custom-proxy/#custom-cdn--api-proxy).
- The `website` app has a prebuild script in order to use the Content Collections CLI directly. The files are cached and not rebuilt in the Next.js build process. This is a workaround for [this issue](https://github.com/sdorra/content-collections/issues/214).
