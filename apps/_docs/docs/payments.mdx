description: In-app payments and webhooks with Stripe.

next-forge uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) by default for payments and billing. Implementing Stripe in your project is straightforward.

## In-App Purchases

You can use Stripe anywhere in your app by importing the `stripe` object like so:

```ts title="page.tsx"
import { stripe } from '@repo/design-system/lib/stripe'; // [!code ++]

// ...

await stripe.prices.list(); // [!code ++]
```

## Webhooks

Stripe webhooks are handled in the `POST /webhooks/stripe` route in the `api` app. This route constructs the event and then switches on the event type to determine how to process the event.

### Local Development

To test webhooks locally, we've configured the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local server. This will start automatically when you run `pnpm dev`.
