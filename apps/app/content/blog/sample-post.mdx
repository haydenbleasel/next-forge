Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create _websites_,_ebooks_,_email_,_chats in discussions forums_.

## Topics

1. Paragraphs

   MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.

2. Text decorations

   MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italiic~~ _italic_ texts

3. Headings No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked.

   ## This is h2

   ### This is h3

4. Links

   [My Github](https://github.com/bhupendra1011 'all repos') account.[Bhupendra][1] github repo.

5. Images Images can be used just like links. ![Alt txt](img url)
