description: How we've configured debugging in next-forge.
---

next-forge has pre-configured [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work as a debugger. The `.vscode/launch.json` file contains the configuration for the debugger and is configured to work for all the apps in the monorepo.

To use the debugger, simply open the app in VSCode (or any VSCode-compatible editor) and go to the Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D on Windows/Linux, ⇧+⌘+D on macOS). Select a launch configuration, then press `F5` or select `Debug: Start Debugging` from the Command Palette to start your debugging session.
