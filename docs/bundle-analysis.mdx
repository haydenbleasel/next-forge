description: How to analyze and optimize your app's bundle size
---

next-forge uses [@vercel/next-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next-bundle-analyzer) to analyze and optimize your app's bundle size. Each app has a `next.config.ts` file that is configured to use the analyzer when the `ANALYZE` environment variable is set to `true`.

## Usage

To run the analyzer, simply run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash Terminal
pnpm analyze
```

Turborepo will automatically run the analyzer for each app when the command is executed.
