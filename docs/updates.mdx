next-forge comes with some built-in helpers to help you keep your dependencies up to date.

## Upgrading next-forge

As next-forge evolves, you may want to stay up to date with the latest changes. This can be difficult to do manually, so we've created a script to help you.

```sh Terminal
npx next-forge@latest update --from 2.18.30 --to 2.18.31
```

This will clone the latest version of next-forge into a temporary directory, apply the updates, and then copy the files over to your project.

## Upgrading dependencies

You can upgrade all the dependencies in all your `package.json` files and installs the new versions with the `bump-deps` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-deps
```

## Upgrading shadcn/ui components

You can upgrade all the shadcn/ui components in the [Design System](/features/design-system/components) package with the `bump-ui` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-ui
```

<Warning>
This will override all customization you've made to the components. To avoid this happening, we recommend proxying the components into a new folder, such as `@repo/design-system/components`.
</Warning>

<Warning>
The `shadcn` CLI will likely make some unwanted changes to your shared Tailwind config file and global CSS. Make sure you review changes before committing them.
