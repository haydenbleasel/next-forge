## Upgrading next-forge

As next-forge evolves, you may want to stay up to date with the latest changes. This can be difficult to do manually, so we've created a script to help you.

```sh Terminal
npx next-forge@latest update --from 2.18.30 --to 2.18.31
```

This will clone the latest version of next-forge into a temporary directory, apply the updates, and then copy the files over to your project. From here, you can commit the changes and push them to your repository.

<Tip>Because next-forge is a boilerplate and not a library, you'll likely need to manually merge the changes you've made with the changes from the update.</Tip>

## Upgrading dependencies

You can upgrade all the dependencies in all your `package.json` files and installs the new versions with the `bump-deps` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-deps
```

This will update all the dependencies in your `package.json` files and install the new versions.

<Tip>You should run a `pnpm build` after running `bump-deps` to ensure the project builds correctly. You should also run `pnpm dev` and ensure the project runs correctly in runtime.</Tip>

## Upgrading shadcn/ui components

You can upgrade all the shadcn/ui components in the [Design System](/packages/design-system/components) package with the `bump-ui` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-ui
```

This will update all the shadcn/ui components, as well as the relevant dependencies in the Design System's `package.json` file.

<Warning>This will override all customization you've made to the components. To avoid this happening, we recommend proxying the components into a new folder, such as `@repo/design-system/components`.</Warning>

<Warning>The `shadcn` CLI will likely make some unwanted changes to your shared Tailwind config file and global CSS. Make sure you review changes before committing them.</Warning>
