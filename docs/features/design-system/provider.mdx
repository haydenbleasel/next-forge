title: Provider
description: A single global provider to wrap your application
---

The design system package also exports a `DesignSystemProvider` component which implements a number of contextual, functional and higher order components, including those for Tooltips, Toasts, Analytics, Dark Mode and more.

This provider is already added to the default apps. If you want to add a new app, make sure you add it to your root layout along with [fonts](/design-system/typography) and global CSS, like so:

```tsx layout.tsx
import '@repo/design-system/styles/globals.css';
import { fonts } from '@repo/design-system/lib/fonts';
import { DesignSystemProvider } from '@repo/design-system';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

type RootLayoutProperties = {
  readonly children: ReactNode;
};

const RootLayout = ({ children }: RootLayoutProperties) => (
  <html lang="en" className={fonts} suppressHydrationWarning>
    <body>
      <DesignSystemProvider>{children}</DesignSystemProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
);

export default RootLayout;
```
