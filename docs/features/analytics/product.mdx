description: Captures product events and metrics.

next-forge has support for product analytics via PostHog â€” a single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features.

## Usage

To capture product events, you can use the `analytics` object exported from the `@repo/analytics` package.

Start by importing the `analytics` object for the relevant environment:

```tsx
// For server-side code
import { analytics } from '@repo/analytics/posthog/server';

// For client-side code
import { analytics } from '@repo/analytics/posthog/client';
```

Then, you can use the `capture` method to send events:

```tsx
analytics.capture({
  event: 'Product Purchased',
  distinctId: 'user_123',
});
```

## Webhooks

To automatically capture authentication and payment events, we've combined PostHog's Node.js server-side library with Clerk and Stripe webhooks to wire it up as follows:

<Mermaid chart={`
graph TD
  A[User Action in App] -->|Triggers| B[Clerk Webhook]
  A -->|Triggers| E[Stripe Webhook]
  A -->|Client-Side Call| PostHog
  B -->|Sends Data| C1[webhooks/clerk]
  E -->|Sends Data| C2[webhooks/stripe]

  subgraph API
    C1
    C2
  end

  subgraph PostHog
  end

  C1 -->|Clerk Events| PostHog
  C2 -->|Stripe Events| PostHog
`} />

## Reverse Proxy

We've also setup Next.js rewrites to reverse proxy PostHog requests, meaning your client-side analytics events won't be blocked by ad blockers.
