description: How to handle environment variables in next-forge

next-forge uses [@t3-oss/env-nextjs](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) to handle environment variables in a type-safe way. This provides runtime validation and autocompletion for all environment variables.

## Overview

Environment variables are defined and validated in `packages/env/index.ts`. The file exports an `env` object that contains all validated environment variables, separated into `server` and `client` variables.

## Initial setup

### App Environment Variables

As part of the initial setup, you will need to fill in the environment variables in each `.env.local` file in each Next.js application, specifically `app`, `web` and `api`.

The initial setup script will copy these `.env.example` files to `.env.local` files, so all you need to do is fill in the variables.

Check out the `packages/env/index.ts` file to see the validation rules for each variable.

<Tip>
  For `FLAGS_SECRET`, you can run `node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"` or `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal to generate a random value.

Some environment variables will be added by integrations and other tooling. For example, environment variables prefixed with `SENTRY_` are automatically added to a Vercel project when you add the Sentry integration from the Vercel Marketplace. Additionally, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` is a very handy environment variable that refers to the "production" URL to which this project is deployed on Vercel.

### Database Environment Variable

You also need to configure a `.env` file in the `packages/database` directory. This file should be created by the setup script, so just add your `DATABASE_URL` and you should be good to go.

### CMS Environment Variable

You also need to configure a `.env.local` file in the `packages/cms` directory. This file should be created by the setup script, so just add your `BASEHUB_TOKEN` and you should be good to go.

## Adding a variable

To add a new environment variable, you need to do two things:

1. Add the variable to each of the `.env.local` files across the repo
2. Add the variable to the `server` or `client` object in `packages/env/index.ts`. The variable will be validated using Zod, so you can use any of the Zod validation primitives.

I recommend being as specific as possible with your validation. For example, if you know that a vendor secret starts with `sec_`, you should validate it as `z.string().min(1).startsWith('sec_')`. This will not only make your intent clearer to anyone reading your code, but will also help prevent errors at runtime.
