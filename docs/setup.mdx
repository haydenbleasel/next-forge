## Prerequisites

### Operating System

next-forge is designed to work on macOS, Linux and Windows. While next-forge itself is platform-agnostic, the tooling and dependencies we use have different requirements. We've tested and confirmed that next-forge works on the following combinations of operating systems and versions:

| Operating system | next-forge version | Node.js version | Notes |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| macOS Sequoia 15.0.1 (24A348) | 2.14.3 | 20.12.2 |  |
| Ubuntu 24.04 Arm64 | 2.14.3 | 20.18.0 |  |
| Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (26100.2033) | 2.14.3 | 20.18.0 | Turborepo only supports specific architectures. `windows ia32` is not supported. |

We're aware of issues on [non-Ubuntu Linux distributions](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/next-forge/issues/238). While we don't officially support them, we'd love to know if you get it working!

### pnpm

next-forge defaults to using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, but you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) instead.

Learn how to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Stripe CLI

We use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local machine. You can read more about that [here](/payments).

Learn how to [install the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) for your operating system.

### Mintlify CLI

We use the Mintlify CLI to preview the docs locally. You can install it with:

```sh Terminal
pnpm add -g @mintlify/cli
```

### Accounts

next-forge relies on various SaaS products. You will need to create accounts with the following services then set the API keys in your [environment variables](/env):

- [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com), for [application security](/security/application).
- [BetterStack](https://betterstack.com), for [logging](/observability/logging) and [uptime monitoring](/observability/uptime).
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com), for [authentication](/authentication).
- [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics), for [web analytics](/analytics/web).
- [Posthog](https://posthog.com), for [product analytics](/analytics/product).
- [Resend](https://resend.com), for [transactional emails](/email/resend).
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io), for [error tracking](/observability/error-capture).
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com), for [payments](/payments).

## Installation

### Cloning

Clone the repo using `next-forge` init, replacing `[my-project]` with your project name.

```sh Terminal
npx next-forge@latest init [my-project]
```

This will create a new directory with your project name and clone the repo into it. It will run a setup script to install dependencies and copy `.env` files.

### Login

Login to Stripe with:

```sh Terminal
stripe login
```

### Environment variables

You should change the environment variables in each `.env` or `.env.local` file to match your own configuration e.g.

```js .env.local
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
```

Read more about environment variables [here](/env).

### Vercel Toolbar

Go into each application and run `vercel link`, like so:

```sh Terminal
cd apps/app
vercel link
```

### Database

You will need to scaffold the database using the schema defined in `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`:

```sh Terminal
pnpm migrate
```

## Development

Run the development server with:

```sh Terminal
pnpm dev
```

Open the localhost URLs with the relevant ports listed above to see the app, e.g.

- [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — The main app.
- [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) — The website.
- [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/) — The API.
- [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/) — Email preview server.
- [http://localhost:3004/](http://localhost:3004/) — The docs
