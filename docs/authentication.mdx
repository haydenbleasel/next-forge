title: Authentication
description: We use Clerk to handle authentication, user and organization management.

[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is used for authentication in next-forge. Clerk provides a complete authentication and user management solution that integrates seamlessly with Next.js applications.

## In-App

The `@repo/auth` package exposes an `AuthProvider`, however you don't need to use this directly. The [`DesignSystemProvider`](/design-system/provider) includes all relevant providers and higher-order components.

From here, you can use all the pre-built components and hooks provided by Clerk. To demonstrate this, we've added the `<OrganizationSwitcher>` and `<UserButton>` components to the sidebar, as well as built out the Sign In and Sign Up pages.

## Webhooks

Clerk uses webhooks to handle authentication events. These are handled in the `POST /webhooks/clerk` route in the `api` app. Make sure you enable the webhook events you need in your Clerk project settings.

### Local Development

To test webhooks locally, you can use Ngrok to expose your local server to the internet. This allows Clerk to send webhooks to your local development environment.

1. Install Ngrok by following the instructions on the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Start your local development server and Ngrok by running the following command in the `api` app:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server on port 3002, the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local server, and Ngrok to expose your local server to the internet.

3. Copy the forwarding URL provided by Ngrok (e.g., `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io`) and add it to your Clerk project's webhook settings.

4. Now you can test Clerk webhooks locally without needing to deploy your app to a staging environment.
