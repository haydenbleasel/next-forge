next-forge uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a frontend workshop for the design system. It allows you to interact with the components in the design system, and see how they behave in different states.

## Configuration

By default, Storybook is configured with every component from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and allows you to interact with them. It is also configured with the relevant fonts and higher-order components to ensure a consistent experience between your application and Storybook.

## Running the workshop

Storybook will start automatically when you run `pnpm dev`. You can also start it independently with `pnpm dev --filter storybook`. The preview will be available at [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

## Adding stories

You can add your own components to the workshop by adding them to the `apps/storybook/stories` directory. Each component should have its own `.stories.tsx` file.
