description: Frontend workshop for the design system
---

next-forge uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a frontend workshop for the design system. It allows you to interact with the components in the design system, and see how they behave in different states.

By default, Storybook is configured with every component from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and allows you to interact with them. You can also add your own components to the workshop by adding them to the `apps/storybook/stories` directory.

It is also pre-configured with the relevant fonts and higher-order components to ensure a consistent experience between your application and Storybook.
