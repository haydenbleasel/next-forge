<Warning>
next-forge support for Auth.js is currently blocked by [this issue](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/11076).
</Warning>

Here's how to switch from Clerk to [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/).

## 1. Replace the dependencies

Uninstall the existing Clerk dependencies from the `auth` package...

```sh Terminal
pnpm remove @clerk/nextjs @clerk/themes @clerk/types --filter auth
```

... and install the Auth.js dependencies.

```sh Terminal
pnpm add next-auth@beta --filter auth
```

## 2. Generate an Auth.js secret

Auth.js requires a random value secret, used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes. In each of the relevant app directories, generate a secret with the following command:

```sh Terminal
cd apps/app && npx auth secret
cd apps/web && npx auth secret
cd apps/api && npx auth secret
```

This will automatically add an `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable to the `.env.local` file in each directory.

## 3. Replace the relevant files

Delete the existing `client.ts` and `server.ts` files in the `auth` package. Then, create the following file:

```tsx packages/auth/index.ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
 
export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [],
});
```

## 4. Update the middleware

Update the `middleware.ts` file in the `auth` package with the following content:

```tsx packages/auth/middleware.ts
import 'server-only';

export { auth as authMiddleware } from './';
```

## 5. Update the auth components

Auth.js has no concept of "sign up", so we'll use the `signIn` function to sign up users. Update both the `sign-in.tsx` and `sign-up.tsx` components in the `auth` package with the same content:

<CodeGroup>

```tsx packages/auth/components/sign-in.tsx
import { signIn } from '../';

export const SignIn = () => (
  <form
    action={async () => {
      "use server";
      await signIn();
    }}
  >
    <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
  </form>
);
```

```tsx packages/auth/components/sign-up.tsx
import { signIn } from '../';

export const SignUp = () => (
  <form
    action={async () => {
      "use server";
      await signIn();
    }}
  >
    <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
  </form>
);
```

</CodeGroup>

## 6. Update the Provider file

Auth.js has no concept of a Provider as a higher-order component, so you can either remove it entirely or just replace it with a stub, like so:

```tsx packages/auth/provider.tsx
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

type AuthProviderProps = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }: AuthProviderProps) => children;
```

## 7. Create an auth route handler

In your `app` application, create an auth route handler file with the following content:

```tsx apps/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { handlers } from "@repo/auth"

export const { GET, POST } = handlers;
```

## 8. Update your apps

From here, you'll need to replace any remaining Clerk implementations in your apps with Auth.js references. This means swapping out references like:

```tsx page.tsx
const { orgId } = await auth();
const { redirectToSignIn } = await auth();
const user = await currentUser();
```

Etcetera. Keep in mind that you'll need to build your own "organization" logic as Auth.js doesn't have a concept of organizations.
