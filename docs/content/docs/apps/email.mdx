<Tip>The `email` application runs on port 3003.</Tip>

next-forge comes with [`react.email`](https://react.email/) built in, allowing you to create and send beautiful emails using React and TypeScript.

`react.email` has a preview server, so you can preview the emails templates in the browser.

To preview the emails templates, simply run the `email` app:

```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm dev --filter email
```
