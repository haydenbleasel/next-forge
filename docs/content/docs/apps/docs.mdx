<Tip>The `docs` application runs on port 3004. We recommend deploying it to `docs.{yourdomain}.com`.</Tip>

next-forge uses [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) to generate beautiful docs. Each page is a `.mdx` file, written in Markdown, with built-in UI components and API playground.

## Creating a new page

To create a new documentation page, add a new MDX file to the `apps/docs` directory. The file name will be used as the slug for the page and the frontmatter will be used to generate the docs page. For example:

```mdx title="apps/docs/hello-world.mdx"
---
title: 'Quickstart'
description: 'Start building modern documentation in under five minutes.'
---
```

Learn more supported [meta tags](https://mintlify.com/docs/page).

## Adding a page to the navigation

To add a page to the sidebar, you'll need to define it in the `mint.json` file in the `apps/docs` directory. From the previous example, here's how you can add it to the sidebar:

```mdx title="mint.json {2-5}"
"navigation": [
  {
    "group": "Getting Started",
    "pages": ["hello-world"]
  },
  {
    // ...
  }
]
```
