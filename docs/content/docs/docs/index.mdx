description: What is next-forge and how do I get started?
---

next-forge is a production-grade [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps. It is designed to be a comprehensive starting point for new apps, providing a solid, opinionated foundation with a minimal amount of configuration.

It is a culmination of my experience building web apps over the last decade and is designed to help you build your new SaaS app as thoroughly as possible, balancing speed and quality.
