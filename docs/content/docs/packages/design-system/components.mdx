description: next-forge offers a default component library by shadcn/ui
---

next-forge contains a design system out of the box powered by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Default configuration

shadcn/ui has been configured by default to use the "New York" style, Tailwind's `neutral` color palette and CSS variables. You can customize the component configuration in `@repo/design-system`, specifically the `components.json` file. All components have been installed and are regularly updated.

## Installing components

To install a new component, use the `shadcn` CLI from the root:

```sh title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latest add select -c packages/design-system
```

This will install the component into the Design System package.

## Updating components

To update shadcn/ui, you can run the following command from the root:

```sh title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latest add --all --overwrite -c packages/design-system
```

We also have a dedicated command for this. Read more about [updates](/docs/updates).

## Changing libraries

If you prefer a different component library, you can replace it at any time with something similar, such as Tailwind's [Catalyst](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/).
