description: How we've implemented JSON-LD structured data.

## Default Configuration

next-forge has a dedicated JSON+LD helper designed to create fully validated Google structured data, making your content more likely to be featured in Google Search results.

By default, structured data is implemented on the following pages:

- `Blog` for the blog index
- `BlogPosting` for the blog post pages

## Usage

Our `@repo/seo` package provides a JSON+LD helper built on `schema-dts`, allowing for structured data generation in a type-safe way. You can declare your own JSON+LD implementations like so:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { JsonLd } from '@repo/seo/json-ld';
import type { WithContext, YourInterface } from '@repo/seo/json-ld';

const jsonLd: WithContext<YourInterface> = {
  // ...
};

return <JsonLd code={jsonLd} />;
```
