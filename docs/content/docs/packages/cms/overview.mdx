next-forge has a dedicated CMS package that can be used to generate type-safe data collections from your content. This approach provides a structured way to manage your content while maintaining full type safety throughout your application. By default, next-forge uses [BaseHub](https://basehub.com) as the CMS.

## Setup

Here's how to quickly get started with your new CMS.

### 1. Fork the [`basehub/next-forge`](https://basehub.com/basehub/next-forge?fork=1) template

You'll be forking a BaseHub repository which contains the next-forge compatible content schema.

Once you fork the repository, you'll need to get your Read Token from the "Connect to your App" page:

```
https://basehub.com/<team-slug>/<repo-slug>/dev/main/dev:connect
```

The token will look something like this:

```
bshb_pk_<password>
```

Keep this connection string handy, you will need it in the next step.

### 2. Update your environment variables

Update your [environment variables](/docs/setup/env) to use the new BaseHub token. For example:

```ts apps/web/.env
BASEHUB_TOKEN="<token>"
```

### 3. Start the dev server

When you run `pnpm dev`, the CMS package will generate the type-safe BaseHub SDK, and watch changes to your CMS's schema.

<Note>You might need to run `Restart TS Server` in your IDE for TypeScript to pick up the new types.</Note>

## Querying Basics

The structure of the CMS should look something like this:

```txt
- Blog
  - Posts
  - Authors
  - Categories
- Legal Pages
```

So in order to get all posts, you'd write a query like this:

```ts
{
  blog: {
    posts: {
      items: {
        _title: true,
        _slug: true,
        authors: { _title: true }, // references the authors collection
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Starter queries are provided for you in the `cms` package, within the `blog` and `legal` objects. You can read more about the BaseHub SDK in [their docs](https://docs.basehub.com/nextjs-integration/).

## Revalidation

A key part of any good CMS integration is the ability to revalidate content when it changes. To do that, BaseHub comes with automatic [on-demand revalidation](https://docs.basehub.com/nextjs-integration/environments-and-caching#on-demand-revalidation-recommended).
