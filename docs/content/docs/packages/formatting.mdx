next-forge uses [Ultracite](https://ultracite.dev) for code formatting and linting. Ultracite is a preconfigured setup of [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), a high-performance Rust-based toolchain which includes a formatter, linter, and more for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Benefits

Ultracite provides several benefits:

- Zero configuration required - works out of the box
- Extremely fast performance
- Consistent code style across your project
- Built-in linting rules
- TypeScript support

## Usage

The formatter and linter are automatically configured in your project and will run on save. If you want to manually run them across your project, you can run the following commands:

- `pnpm lint` - This will check all files across all apps and packages.
- `pnpm format` - This will check and fix all files across all apps and packages.
