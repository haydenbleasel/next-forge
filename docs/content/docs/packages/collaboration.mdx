next-forge maintains a `collaboration` package designed to provide real-time collaborative features to your apps. By default, we use [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) as our collaboration engine. To showcase what you can do with this package, we've built a simple collaborative experience in the `app` application, featuring an avatar stack and live cursors.

<Tip>Collaboration is enabled by the existence of the `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET` environment variable.</Tip>

## How it works

Liveblocks relies on the concept of rooms, digital spaces where people collaborate. To set this up, you need to [authenticate your users](https://liveblocks.io/docs/authentication/access-token/nextjs), and [add the correct providers](https://liveblocks.io/docs/get-started/nextjs), however next-forge has already integrated this, meaning you can start building your collaborative application immediately.

We've also wired up two key props for the Liveblocks provider, `resolveUsers` and `resolveMentionSuggestions`, which are used to resolve the users and mention suggestions respectively.

## Usage

Liveblocks provides a number of hooks making it easy to add real-time presence and document storage to your app. For example, [`useOthers`]() returns which users are currently connected, helpful for building avatars stacks and multiplayer cursors.

```tsx title="toolbar-avatars.tsx"
import { useOthers, useSelf } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

export function ToolbarAvatars() {
  const others = useOthers();
  const me = useSelf();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your avatar */}
      <Avatar src={me.info.avatar} name={me.info.name} />

      {/* Everyone else's avatars */}
      {others.map(({ connectionId, info }) => (
        <Avatar key={connectionId} src={info.avatar} name={info.name} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Multiplayer documents

You can take your collaborative app a step further, and set up multiplayer document state with [`useStorage`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useStorage) and [`useMutation`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation). This is ideal for creating custom experiences, such as a a multiplayer drawing panel, spreadsheet, or just a simple shared input and that anyone can edit.

```tsx title="collaborative-input.tsx"
import { useStorage, useMutation } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

function CollaborativeInput() {
  // Get the input's value
  const inputValue = useStorage((root) => root.inputValue);
  
  // Set the input's value
  const setValue = useMutation(({ storage }), newValue) => {
    storage.set("inputValue", newValue);
  }, []);
  
  return <input value={inputValue} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

### Commenting

Liveblocks also provides ready-made customizable components for adding collaboration, such as [`Thread`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Thread) and [`Composer`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Composer).

```tsx title="comments.tsx"
import { useThreads } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";
import { Thread, Composer } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";

function Comments() {
  // Get each thread of comments and render them
  const { threads } = useThreads();

  return (
    <div>
      {threads.map((thread) => (
        <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
      ))}
      <Composer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Collaborative editing

To add a rich-text editor with full collaborative editing and floating comments, you can set up a [Tiptap](https://liveblocks.io/docs/get-started/nextjs-tiptap) or [Lexical](https://liveblocks.io/docs/get-started/nextjs-lexical) editor in a few lines of code.

```tsx title="collaborative-editor.tsx"
import { useLiveblocksExtension, FloatingComposer, FloatingThreads } from "@liveblocks/react-tiptap";
import { useThreads, useEditor, EditorContent } from "@tiptap/react";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

export function Editor() {
  const { threads } = useThreads();
  const liveblocks = useLiveblocksExtension();

  // Set up your multiplayer text editor
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      liveblocks,
      StarterKit.configure({ history: false }),
    ],
    immediatelyRender: false,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
      <FloatingThreads
        editor={editor}
        threads={threads}
      />
      <FloatingComposer editor={editor} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Notifications

Liveblocks also provides [notification components](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#InboxNotificationList), meaning you can send in-app notifications to users that are tagged in comments, are mentioned in the text editor, or for any custom purpose.

```tsx title="notifications.tsx"
import { useInboxNotifications } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";
import {
  InboxNotification,
  InboxNotificationList,
} from "@liveblocks/react-ui";

export function CollaborativeApp() {
  // Get each notification for the current user
  const { inboxNotifications } = useInboxNotifications();

  return (
    <InboxNotificationList>
      {inboxNotifications.map((inboxNotification) => (
        <InboxNotification
          key={inboxNotification.id}
          inboxNotification={inboxNotification}
        />
      ))}
    </InboxNotificationList>
  );
}
```

### Infrastructure

Liveblocks not only provides these features, but it also has:
- [Browser DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools) to help you build your app.
- [REST APIs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints) for sever-side changes.
- [Node.js SDK](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) for using the REST APIs with TypeScript.
- [Webhooks](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/webhooks) for triggering user-driven events.
- [Dashboard](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/projects) to help with bug spotting and analytics.
