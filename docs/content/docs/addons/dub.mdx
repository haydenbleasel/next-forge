While next-forge does not come with link tracking and analytics out of the box, you can easily add it to your app with [Dub](https://dub.co/).

## Overview

Dub is an open-source link tracking and analytics platform that allows you to track the performance of your links and see how they're performing. It comes with a suite of features that make it a great choice for marketing teams, including link shortening, custom domains, branded QR codes, and more.

## Signing up

You can sign up for a Dub account [on their website](https://app.dub.co/register).

## Creating a link

Once you've signed up, you can create a link by clicking the "Create Link" button in the top right corner.

## Adding link tracking to your app

From here, simply replace all `href` values with the Dub link!

```tsx
<a href="https://dub.co/example">Example</a>
<Link href="https://dub.co/example">Example</Link>
```

## Interfacing programmatically

Dub provides a simple SDK for creating links, managing customers, tracking leads and more. You can install it with:

```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm add dub
```

For more information on the SDK, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/introduction).
