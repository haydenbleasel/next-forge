The `tailwind-config` package is a configuration package for Tailwind CSS. It is used to configure the Tailwind CSS app and is located in the `packages/tailwind-config` directory.

The configuration extends Tailwind's default setup with shadcn/ui, as well as typography configuration. It also utilizes two plugins:

- `@tailwindcss/typography` for prose styling
- `tailwindcss-animate` for animation utilities
