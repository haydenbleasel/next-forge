next-forge supports sending in-app notifications to your users using [Knock](https://knock.app/). Knock is a cross-channel notification platform that supports in-app, email, SMS, push, and chat notifications.


## How it works

Knock allows you to centralize your notification logic and templates in one place and [orchestrate complex workflows](https://docs.knock.app/designing-workflows/overview) with things like branching, batching, throttling, delays, and conditional sending. To use Knock with next-forge, you need to provide values for the [`KNOCK_API_KEY`,`KNOCK_SECRET_API_KEY`](https://docs.knock.app/developer-tools/api-keys), and `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID` environment variables.

## Usage

### Render an in-app feed
To render an in-app feed, import the `Feed` component from the `@repo/notifications` package and use it in your app:


```tsx
import { Feed } from '@repo/notifications/feed';

<Feed/>
```

### Send a notification

Knock sends notifications using workflows. To send an in-app notification, create a new [workflow](https://docs.knock.app/concepts/workflows) in the Knock dashboard that uses the [`in-app` channel provider](https://docs.knock.app/integrations/in-app/knock) and create a corresponding message template.

Then you can [trigger that workflow](https://docs.knock.app/send-notifications/triggering-workflows) for a particular user in your app, passing in the necessary data to populate the message template:
```tsx
import { notifications } from '@repo/notifications';

await notifications.workflows.trigger('workflow-key', {
  recipients: [{
    id: 'user-id',
    email: 'user-email',
  }],
  data: {
    message: 'Hello, world!',
  },
});
```

### Creating multi-channel notifications
Using Knock, you can add additional channel providers to your workflow to send notifications via email, SMS, push, or chat. To do this, create a new [channel provider](https://docs.knock.app/integrations) in the Knock dashboard, follow any configuration instructions for that provider, and add it to your workflow as a channel step.
