next-forge includes a powerful internationalization package that enables you to add multiple language support to your application with minimal configuration. The package handles language detection, routing, and content management through a dictionary-based approach.

## How it works

The internationalization system is built on [Next.js Internationalization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)'s routing system and [Languine](https://languine.dev)'s translation system.

It's configured by default for the `web` package to:

1. Detect the user's preferred language through browser headers
2. Route users to language-specific paths (e.g., `/en/about`, `/fr/about`)
3. Serve content from language-specific dictionaries

The package handles language detection and matching, ensuring users see content in their preferred language when available.

## Setup

To enable automatic translations, simply create a `.env` file in the `internationalization` package and set the `LANGUINE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

```env .env
LANGUINE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
```

## Configuration

The internationalization package is configured through a `languine.json` file that defines:

- Source locale (e.g., "en")
- Target locales (e.g., ["es", "de"])
- Dictionary file locations

---

## Dictionary Structure

Dictionaries are TypeScript files that export strongly-typed content for each supported language. The type system ensures consistency across translations:

```ts
import type { Dictionary } from '@repo/internationalization';

const dictionary: Dictionary = {};

export default dictionary;
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the internationalization package, you need to:

1. Create a dictionary for each language you want to support.
2. Import the dictionary into your application.
3. Use the dictionary to render content.

```tsx
import { getDictionary } from '@repo/internationalization';

const dictionary = await getDictionary('en');
```

### Advanced Usage

The internationalization package also includes a middleware component that automatically detects the user's language and routes them to the appropriate language-specific page.

```tsx
import { internationalizationMiddleware } from '@repo/internationalization';

export default internationalizationMiddleware;
```

## Customization

The internationalization package can be customized to meet your specific needs.

### Changing the default locale

To change the default locale, you can set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE` environment variable.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE="en"
```
