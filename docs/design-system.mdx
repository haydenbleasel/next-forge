title: Design System
description: A beautiful, robust component library using shadcn/ui
---

## Overview

next-forge contains a design system out of the box powered by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It has been configured by default to use Tailwind's `neutral` color palette, as well as CSS variables.

## Components

All components have been installed and are regularly updated, however you can replace the design system components at any time with something similar, such as Tailwind's [Catalyst](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/).

## Fonts

The design system package also contains a pre-configured fonts file, which has been wired up to all the apps. This `fonts.ts` file imports the default font Geist from Google Fonts, configures the appropriate subset and CSS variable name, then exports a `className` you can use in your app. This CSS variable is then applied to the shared Tailwind configuration.

By default, `fonts.ts` exports a `sans` and `mono` font, but you can configure this to export as many as you need e.g. heading, body, secondary, etc. You can also replace fonts entirely simply by replacing the font name, like so:

```ts packages/design-system/lib/fonts.ts
import { Acme } from 'next/font/google';

const sans = Acme({ subsets: ['latin'], variable: '--font-sans' });
```

You can also load fonts locally. Read more about this on the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/).

## Provider

The design system package also exports a `DesignSystemProvider` component which implements a number of contextual, functional and higher order components, including those for Tooltips, Toasts, Analytics, Dark Mode and more.

This provider is already added to the default apps. If you want to add a new app, make sure you add it to your root layout along with fonts and global CSS, like so:

```tsx layout.tsx
import '@repo/design-system/styles/globals.css';
import { fonts } from '@repo/design-system/lib/fonts';
import { DesignSystemProvider } from '@repo/design-system/providers';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

type RootLayoutProperties = {
  readonly children: ReactNode;
};

const RootLayout = ({ children }: RootLayoutProperties) => (
  <html lang="en" className={fonts} suppressHydrationWarning>
    <body>
      <DesignSystemProvider>{children}</DesignSystemProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
);

export default RootLayout;
```
