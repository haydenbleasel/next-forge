next-forge supports sending webhooks to your users using [Svix](https://www.svix.com/). Svix is an enterprise-ready webhooks sending service.

## How it works

next-forge uses the Svix API in a stateless manner. The organization ID from the authenticated user is used as the Svix application UID, which is created automatically when the first message is sent.

## Usage

### Send a webhook

To send a webhook, simply use the `send` function from the `@repo/webhooks` package:

```tsx
import { webhooks } from '@repo/webhooks';

await webhooks.send('invoice.created', {
  data: {
    id: 'inv_1234567890',
  },
});
```

### Add webhook endpoints

Svix provides a pre-built [consumer application portal](https://docs.svix.com/app-portal), where users add endpoints and manage everything related to their webhooks subscriptions. App portal access is based on short-lived sessions using special magic links, and can be [embed in an iframe in your dashboard](https://docs.svix.com/app-portal#embedding-in-a-react-application).

To get access to the application portal, use the `getAppPortal` function from `@repo/webhooks` and use the returned URL in an `iframe` on your dashboard.

```tsx
import { webhooks } from '@repo/webhooks';

const { url } = await webhooks.getAppPortal();

return (
  <iframe src={url} style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" allow="clipboard-write" loading="lazy" />
);
```

We have a prebuilt page at `/webhooks` that you can use as a starting point.
