description: The apps of next-forge
---

next-forge is a monorepo, which means it contains multiple packages in a single repository. This is a common pattern for modern web applications, as it allows you to share code between different parts of the application, and manage them all together.

The monorepo is managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), which is a tool for managing monorepos. It provides a simple way to manage multiple packages in a single repository, and is designed to work with modern web applications.

The monorepo contains the following apps:

| App | Description | Port |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `api` | Contains serverless functions designed to run separately from the main app e.g. webhooks and cron jobs. | 3002 |
| `app` | The main application, featuring a [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) template. | 3000 |
| `docs` | The documentation, which contains the documentation for the app e.g. guides and tutorials. | 3004 |
| `email` | The email preview server from [react.email](https://react.email/). | 3003 |
| `studio` | [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio), which is a graphical editor for the database. | 3005 |
| `web` | The website, featuring a [twblocks](https://www.twblocks.com/) template. | 3001 |
