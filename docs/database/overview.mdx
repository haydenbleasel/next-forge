sidebarTitle: Overview
---

By default, next-forge uses [Neon](https://neon.tech) as its database provider. However, you can easily switch to another provider like [PlanetScale](/database/planetscale), [Prisma Postgres](/database/prisma-postgres), Supabase, or any other PostgreSQL/MySQL provider.

Database access is configured in `@repo/database` via [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). It provides a type-safe database client that makes it easy to work with your database while maintaining strong typing throughout your application.

## Overview

Prisma serves several key purposes in our stack:

- Provides a declarative way to define your database schema
- Generates type-safe database client
- Handles database migrations
- Offers powerful query capabilities with full TypeScript support

## Schema Definition

The database schema is defined in `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`. This schema file uses Prisma's schema definition language to describe your database tables, relationships, and types.

### Adding a new model

Let's say we want to add a new model called `Post`, describing a blog post. The blog content will be in a JSON format, generated by a library like [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/). To do this, we would add the following to your schema:

```prisma packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma {1-7}
model Post {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  title     String
  content   Json
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Deploying changes

To deploy your schema changes, run the following command:

```bash Terminal
pnpm migrate
```

This runs the following commands:

- `npx prisma format` to format the schema file
- `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client
- `npx prisma db push` to push the schema changes to the database

## Prisma Studio

next-forge includes Prisma Studio, which is a visual editor for your database. To start it, run the following command:

```bash Terminal
pnpm dev --filter studio
```
