While next-forge does not come with BI tooling out of the box, you can easily add business intelligence and analytics to your app with [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).

## Overview

Metabase is an open-source business intelligence platform. You can use Metabase to ask questions about your data, or embed Metabase in your app to let your customers explore their data on their own.

## Installing Metabase

Metabase provides an official Docker image via Dockerhub that can be used for deployments on any system that is running Docker. Here's a one-liner that will start a container running Metabase.

```sh
docker run -d --name metabase -p 3000:3000 metabase/metabase
```

You can also install Metabase by running the JAR file. Links to different installations:

- [Docker Documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/running-metabase-on-docker)
- [Jar File Documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/running-the-metabase-jar-file)

## Database Connection

By default, next-forge uses Neon as its database provider. Metabase works great with Postgres databases so if you're ready to connect, here's what you'll need:

- The `hostname` of the server where your database lives
- The `port` the database server uses
- The `database name`
- The `username` you use for the database
- The `password` you use for the database

You can find these details in your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```js
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@[hostname]:[port]/[database_name]?sslmode=require"
```

Next, plug your database connection credentials into Metabase:

Metabase supports over 20 databases. If you're working with a database other than postgres and want to integrate it, check out the [Metabase Database Documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/databases/connecting).

## Asking Questions and building Dashboards

Now that you have installed Metabase, have database credentials, you can start asking [Questions](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/questions/query-builder/introduction) and building [Dashboards](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/dashboards/introduction).
