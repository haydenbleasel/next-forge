title: Dark Mode
description: How to use dark mode in the design system.

next-forge comes with built-in dark mode support through the combination of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) and [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

## Implementation

The dark mode implementation uses Tailwind's `darkMode: 'class'` strategy, which toggles dark mode by adding a `dark` class to the `html` element. This approach provides better control over dark mode and prevents flash of incorrect theme.

The `next-themes` provider is already configured in the application, handling theme persistence and system preference detection automatically. Third-party components like Clerk's Provider and Sonner have also been preconfigured to respect this setup.

## Usage

By default, each application theme will default to the user's operating system preference.

To allow the user to change theme manually, you can use the `ModeToggle` component which is located in the Design System package. We've already added it to the `app` sidebar and `web` navbar, but you can import it anywhere:

```tsx page.tsx
import { ModeToggle } from '@repo/design-system/components/mode-toggle';

const MyPage = () => (
  <ModeToggle />
);
```

You can check the theme by using the `useTheme` hook directly from `next-themes`. For example:

```tsx page.tsx
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

const MyPage = () => {
  const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme();

  return resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? 'Dark mode baby' : 'Light mode ftw';
}
```
