next-forge comes out the box with a design system package that offers [components](/design-system/components), [typography](/design-system/typography), [colors](/design-system/colors) and [providers](/design-system/providers). There's also full support for [Dark Mode](/design-system) through the use of next-themes and Tailwind.
