description: next-forge offers a default component library by shadcn/ui

next-forge contains a design system out of the box powered by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It has been configured by default to use Tailwind's `neutral` color palette, as well as CSS variables.

All components have been installed and are regularly updated, however you can replace the design system components at any time with something similar, such as Tailwind's [Catalyst](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/).
