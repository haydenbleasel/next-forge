description: How to configure your development environment for next-forge
---

## Operating System

next-forge is designed to work on macOS, Linux and Windows. While next-forge itself is platform-agnostic, the tooling and dependencies we use have different requirements. We've tested and confirmed that next-forge works on the following combinations of operating systems and versions:

| Operating system | next-forge version | Node.js version | Notes |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| macOS Sequoia 15.0.1 (24A348) | 2.14.3 | 20.12.2 |  |
| Ubuntu 24.04 Arm64 | 2.14.3 | 20.18.0 |  |
| Fedora, Release 41 | 2.14.3 | 22.11.0 |  |
| Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (26100.2033) | 2.14.3 | 20.18.0 | Turborepo only supports specific architectures. `windows ia32` is not supported. |

We're aware of issues on [non-Ubuntu Linux distributions](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/next-forge/issues/238). While we don't officially support them, we'd love to know if you get it working!

## Package Manager

next-forge defaults to using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, but you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) instead.

| Package Manager | Supported |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| pnpm | ✅ |
| npm | ✅ |
| yarn | ✅ |
| bun | ✅ |

Learn how to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

## Stripe CLI

We use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local machine. You can read more about that [here](/features/payments).

Learn how to [install the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) for your operating system.

## Mintlify CLI

We use the Mintlify CLI to preview the docs locally. You can install it with:

```sh Terminal
pnpm add -g @mintlify/cli
```

## Accounts

next-forge relies on various SaaS products. You will need to create accounts with the following services then set the API keys in your [environment variables](/features/env):

- [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com), for [application security](/features/security/application).
- [BetterStack](https://betterstack.com), for [logging](/features/observability/logging) and [uptime monitoring](/features/observability/uptime).
