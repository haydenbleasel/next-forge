## zustand Library

The `zustand` library is a small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution for React applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage state in your application.

### Installation

To install the `zustand` library, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash npm
npm install zustand
```

```bash yarn
yarn add zustand
```

### Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `zustand` library for state management:

```javascript
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
}));

function Counter() {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useStore();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `create` function from the `zustand` library is used to create a store with a `count` state and `increment` and `decrement` actions. The `useStore` hook is then used in the `Counter` component to access the state and actions.

### Benefits

- **Simple API**: The `zustand` library provides a simple and intuitive API for managing state in your React application.
- **Performance**: The `zustand` library is optimized for performance, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Scalability**: The `zustand` library is scalable and can be used to manage state in applications of any size.
