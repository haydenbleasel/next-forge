next-forge uses [Prisma](https://prisma.io) as its ORM by default. However, you can easily switch to another ORM like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) or [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/).

We selected Prisma because as of writing this, it's the most popular ORM and has a large community and many adapters. However, Drizzle is coming up fast and has some great benefits, primarily around performance.

If you want to switch to Drizzle, you have two options:

1. Keep Prisma and add the Drizzle API to the Prisma client. Drizzle have a [great guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/prisma) on how to do this.
2. Go all-in and switch to Drizzle.

Here, I'll assume you have a working Neon database and cover the second option.

## 1. Swap out the required dependencies in `@repo/database`

Uninstall the existing dependencies...

<CodeGroup>
```sh npm
npm uninstall @prisma/adapter-neon @prisma/client prisma --filter database
```
```sh pnpm
pnpm remove @prisma/adapter-neon @prisma/client prisma --filter database
```
```sh yarn
yarn remove @prisma/adapter-neon @prisma/client prisma --filter database
```
```sh bun
bun remove @prisma/adapter-neon @prisma/client prisma --filter database
```
</CodeGroup>

...and install the new ones:

<CodeGroup>
```sh npm
npm install drizzle-orm --filter database
npm install -D drizzle-kit --filter database
```
```sh pnpm
pnpm add drizzle-orm --filter database
pnpm add -D drizzle-kit --filter database
```
```sh yarn
yarn add drizzle-orm --filter database
yarn add --dev drizzle-kit --filter database
```
```sh bun
bun add drizzle-orm --filter database
bun add --dev drizzle-kit --filter database
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Update the database connection code

Delete everything in `@repo/database/index.ts` and replace it with the following:

```ts packages/database/index.ts
import 'server-only';

import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { env } from '@repo/env';

const client = neon(databaseUrl);

export const database = drizzle({ client });
```

## 3. Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file

Next we'll create a Drizzle configuration file, used by Drizzle Kit and contains all the information about your database connection, migration folder and schema files. Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the `packages/database` directory with the following contents:

```ts packages/database/drizzle.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit';
import { env } from '@repo/env';

export default defineConfig({
  schema: './schema.ts',
  out: './',
  dialect: 'postgresql',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: databaseUrl,
  },
});
```

## 4. Generate the schema file

Drizzle uses a schema file to define your database tables. Rather than create one from scratch, we can generate it from the existing database. In the `packages/database` folder, run the following command to generate the schema file:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit pull
```

This should pull the schema from the database, creating a `schema.ts` file containing the table definitions and some other files.

## 5. Update your queries

Now you can update your queries to use the Drizzle ORM.

For example, here's how we can update the `page` query in `app/(authenticated)/page.tsx`:

```ts apps/app/app/(authenticated)/page.tsx {2, 7}
import { database } from '@repo/database';
import { page } from '@repo/database/schema';

// ...

const App = async (): Promise<ReactElement> => {
  const pages = await database.select().from(page);

  // ...
};

export default App;
```
