next-forge comes with two types of analytics:

1. [Web Analytics](/analytics/web) - Captures pageviews, pageleave and custom events.
2. [Product Analytics](/analytics/product) - Captures product events and metrics.

Both of these are useful for understanding how users are interacting with your product.
