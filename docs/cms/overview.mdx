description: How the CMS is configured in next-forge.
---

next-forge has a dedicated CMS package that can be used to generate type-safe data collections from your content. This approach provides a structured way to manage your content while maintaining full type safety throughout your application.

By default, next-forge uses [BaseHub](https://basehub.com) as the CMS. However, it is also possible to use other sources, such as [Content Collections](/cms/content-collections) to generate type-safe data collections from MDX files.

## Setup

Here's how to quickly get started with your new CMS.

### 1. Fork the [`basehub/next-forge`](https://basehub.com/basehub/next-forge) template

You'll be forking a BaseHub repository which contains the next-forge compatible content schema.

Once you fork the repository, you'll need to get your Read Token from the Connect page:

```
https://basehub.com/<team-slug>/<repo-slug>/dev/main/dev:connect
```

The token will look something like this:

```
bshb_pk_<password>
```

Keep this connection string handy, you will need it in the next step.

### 2. Update your environment variables

Update your [environment variables](/env) to use the new BaseHub token. For example:

```ts apps/web/.env
BASEHUB_TOKEN="<token>"
```

## How it works

### BaseHub Toolbar

Mount the `Toolbar` component in your `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` file to ensure [Automatic On-Demand Revalidation](https://docs.basehub.com/documentation/nextjs-integration/environments-and-caching#on-demand-revalidation-recommended) works as expected, and Preview Links from the BaseHub Dashboard do so as well.

```tsx apps/web/app/layout.tsx {11}
import { Toolbar } from 'basehub/next-toolbar';

const RootLayout = ({ children }: RootLayoutProperties) => (
  <html lang="en" className={fonts} suppressHydrationWarning>
    <body>
      <DesignSystemProvider>
        <Header />
        {children}
        <Footer />
      </DesignSystemProvider>
      <Toolbar />
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

### BaseHub Image

BaseHub comes with built in image resizing and optimization. It is recommended to use the `BaseHubImage` component instead of the standard `Image` component. This component uses `Image` under the hood, but adds a custom loader to leverage BaseHub's image pipeline.

Import it like so:

```tsx
import { BaseHubImage } from 'basehub/next-image';
```
