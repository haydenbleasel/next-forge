description: How we've implemented JSON-LD for our blog posts
---

next-forge has JSON+LD structured data configured for blog posts by default. It's currently wired up to convey the title, description, author, date published, and tags. This is fully validated Google structured data validated JSON-LD markup for the ARTICLE schema markup type and should make your blog posts more likely to be featured in Google Search results.

JSON+LD is implemented in a type-safe way through the use of `schema-dts`.
