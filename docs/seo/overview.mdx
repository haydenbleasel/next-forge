description: How we optimize your site for search engines.
---

next-forge tries to abstract and automate as much on-site search engine optimization as possible. We do this through three methods:

1. [Metadata](/seo/metadata) for generating a robust set of link, meta and script tags.
2. [JSON+LD](/seo/json-ld) for constructing structured data for search engines.
3. [Sitemap](/seo/sitemap) for automatically generating sitemaps.
