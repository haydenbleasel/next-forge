next-forge maintains a `collaboration` package designed to provide real-time collaborative features to your apps. By default, we use [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) as our collaboration engine. To showcase what you can do with this package, we've built a simple collaborative experience in the `app` application, featuring an avatar stack and live cursors.
