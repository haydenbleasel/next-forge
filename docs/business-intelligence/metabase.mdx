next-forge has support for business intelligence and analytics via Metabase.

## Overview

Metabase is an open-source business intelligence platform. You can use Metabase to ask questions about your data, or embed Metabase in your app to let your customers explore their data on their own.

## Installing Metabase

Metabase provides an official Docker image via Dockerhub that can be used for deployments on any system that is running Docker. Here's a one-liner that will start a container running Metabase.

```sh
docker run -d --name metabase -p 3000:3000 metabase/metabase
```

You can also install Metabase by running the JAR file. Links to different installations:

## Database Connection

By default, next-forge uses Neon as its database provider. Metabase works great with postgres databases so if you're ready to connect, here's what you'll need:
- The `hostname` of the server where your database lives
- The `port` the database server uses
- The `database name`
- The `username` you use for the database
- The `password` you use for the database

In Neon, you can find your connection details under your Project Dashboard:
![Connection Details](../images/authors/metabase/metabase-neon-connection-details.png "Connection Details")

Next, plug your database connection credentials into Metabase:
![Add Database](../images/authors/metabase/metabase-add-database.png "Add Database")

Metabase supports over 20 databases. If you're working with a database other than postgres and want to integrate it, check out the [Metabase Database Documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/databases/connecting).

## Asking Questions and building Dashboards

Now that you have installed Metabase, have database credentials, you can start asking [Questions](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/questions/query-builder/introduction) and building [Dashboards](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/dashboards/introduction).
