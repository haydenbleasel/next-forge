next-forge uses [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com/), a security as code product that includes several features that can be used individually or combined to provide defense in depth for your site. You can [sign up for a free account](https://arcjet.com/) and add the API key to the environment variables to use the features we have included.

## Configuration

[Arcjet bot detection](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/concepts) is configured to prevent scrapers and other automated clients. You can [configure additional bot types](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/identifying-bots) to allow or block. [Arcjet Shield WAF](https://docs.arcjet.com/shield/concepts) will detect and block common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

### Web

For the `web` app, bot detection and the Arcjet Shield WAF are both configured in the Middleware to block scrapers and other bots, but still allow search engines and preview link generators. This will run on every request by default, except for static assets.

### App

For `app`, there is a central Arcjet client configured at `@repo/security` which includes the Arcjet Shield WAF rules. This client is extended in the authenticated route layout in `apps/app/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` with bot detection to block all bots except preview link generators. This will run just on authenticated routes. 

When a rule is triggered, the request will be blocked and an error returned. You can customize the error message in code, redirect to a different page, or handle the error in a different way as needed.

## Scaling up your security

Arcjet includes other features like PII detection, rate limiting, and email validation. They're not used in the boilerplate, but can be added as needed.

## Notes

Clerk includes bot detection and rate limiting in their login route handlers by default.
