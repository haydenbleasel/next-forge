## Comments

pre-emptively add comments to explain "why" behind the code.
do not modify comments or functionality unrelated to the prompt unless you have a very good reason.
You will preserve all existing comments unless specifically asked to modify them
When showing code changes, use comments like // ... to indicate unchanged sections of code

## File structure

Prefer `hyphen-case.ext` over `CamelCase.ext`.
Use `@/server/actions` for all server actions.
Use `@/server/services` for all internal services.

## Coding conventions

pre-emptively ask questions if you are unsure about the requirements.
pre-emptively optimize code for production.
pre-emptively add types to all functions and variables.
pre-emptively fix any typescript errors or warnings.

Use open-source libraries when they would enhance the user/developer experience.
Use best practices, write production-ready code.
Fix bugs and improve performance.
Comment any complex or hard-to-read code.
fix all typescript errors and warnings.

## When writing React

Prefer `export const fn = () => {}` over `export default function fn() {}`.
Use functional components and hooks for state management.
Ensure components are reusable and maintainable.
Prefer server actions for internal API requests.
Maintain a separation of concerns between client and server components.

## When interacting with the database

1. Ensure all required fields are provided when interacting with the database.
2. Check for potential undefined values and handle them appropriately.
3. Use TypeScript's type system to enforce correct data structures.
4. Implement error handling for database operations and API requests.
5. Validate input data to prevent runtime errors and ensure data integrity.
6. Add comments to explain complex logic or important decisions in the code.
7. Regularly review and test code to catch and fix errors early.

## API Integration

- Use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys.
- Handle API errors gracefully and provide user feedback.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations to improve readability.
- Document API interactions and expected responses.

## UI/UX Design

- Follow Tailwind CSS conventions for styling.
- Ensure responsive design for all components.
- Use Shadcn/UI components for consistency in UI elements.
- Prioritize accessibility in UI design.

## Performance Optimization

- Optimize images and assets for faster load times.
- Use lazy loading for components and images where applicable.
- Minimize the use of heavy libraries and dependencies.
- Regularly audit and improve performance metrics.
